# BackSwap Research
## Tools and IOC

This repository stores a [Python3 script](/backswap_extractor.py) (radare2 r2pipe) that was used to extract information and decrypt the shellcodes of BackSwap Banker. Also, this repository contains a [CSV file](backswap_ioc.csv) with ~200 of samples that were tracked and analyzed during the few months.  
  
The research can be found [here](https://research.checkpoint.com/the-evolution-of-backswap/).
